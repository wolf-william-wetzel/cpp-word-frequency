# Overview

This is a simple program written in C++ to analyze a file and count the frequencies of the words within.

I wrote this software to learn the basics of C++.

# Future Work

- Add option for user to specify absolute paths to files.
- Sort the words alphabetically or by frequency.
- Following above, add option for user to choose how to sort the words.
- Add functionality to count letter frequency or even symbol frequency.
